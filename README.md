# Employee Directory  
![badge](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=React&message=SNES&color=blue)  
## Description  
This is my first React App that uses components, axios, randomUser, and state  
I was able to pass functions to other components and manipulate the state  
of the parent App from those components.  React got me excited to start  
this project early.  Moving from no frameworks to seeing the power that  
they can weild easily makes me even more excited to move foward learning more.
